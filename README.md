I am an economist by training and a web developer by passion. Last year, I started almost one year Web Developer Plus bootcamp at the Kodilla programming school. This intensive and practice-oriented course ignited my passion for programming. Currently, I am professionally involved in accounting. Through my previous work experience, I have proved that I am a reliable, well-organized and stress-resistant team player. I’d be happy to use all my assets in the role of a junior programmer.
